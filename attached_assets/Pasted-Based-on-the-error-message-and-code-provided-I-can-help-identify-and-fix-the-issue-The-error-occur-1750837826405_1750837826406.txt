Based on the error message and code provided, I can help identify and fix the issue. The error occurs because the data loading process cannot find a datetime column in the DataFrame. Let's analyze the problem:

The error message shows:
```
ValueError: No datetime column found. Available columns: ['2008-01-02 06:00:00', '3352.5', '3353.75', '3351.75', '3353.25', '184']
```


The issue is that the first column appears to be a datetime value ('2008-01-02 06:00:00') but is being treated as column name instead of data. This typically happens when the CSV/data file is read without properly specifying column headers.

Here's how we can fix this. We need to modify the `load_and_cache_data` function in data_preprocessing.py to properly handle the data format. While I don't see the full implementation of this function, here's a solution that would fix the issue:

```python
def load_and_cache_data(data_folder, cache_folder):
    """Load data from text files and cache processed results."""
    # Read the data with no header, and then set appropriate column names
    df = pd.read_csv(data_folder, header=None, 
                     names=['DateTime', 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Volume'])
    
    # Convert DateTime column to proper datetime format
    df['DateTime'] = pd.to_datetime(df['DateTime'])
    
    return df
```


This solution:
1. Reads the data without assuming a header row
2. Explicitly assigns column names that match the data structure
3. Ensures the DateTime column is properly formatted

The key changes are:
- Using `header=None` to prevent the first row from being treated as headers
- Explicitly naming the columns using the `names` parameter
- Converting the DateTime column to proper datetime format

This should resolve the "No datetime column found" error while properly preserving your time series data for analysis.

If you'd like to implement this fix, you can modify your data_preprocessing.py file with these changes. The rest of your processing pipeline should work as expected once the datetime column is properly recognized.

Would you like me to provide any additional details or explain any part of the solution further?
