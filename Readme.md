# Comprehensive Theory of ga_policy_evolution.py

## üìå Overview

The `ga_policy_evolution.py` script implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) tailored to optimize neural network-based trading policies. Genetic algorithms (GAs) are evolutionary algorithms inspired by natural selection principles, where a population of candidate solutions evolves iteratively toward an optimal solution. This script specifically evolves parameters for a neural network policy using GPU acceleration and supports distributed training for efficiency and scalability.

---

## üöÄ Theoretical Background

Genetic Algorithms (GA) are evolutionary algorithms based on natural selection and genetics principles:

- **Population Initialization**: Start with a set of randomly initialized neural networks (policies).

# Comprehensive Theory of policy_gradient_methods.py

## üìå Overview

The `policy_gradient_methods.py` script implements Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a modern reinforcement learning algorithm known for its stability, efficiency, and ability to manage complex continuous-action spaces typical in financial trading environments. PPO effectively trains a neural network model to optimize policy performance by balancing exploration and exploitation, leveraging gradient-based updates to find optimal trading strategies.

---

## üöÄ Theoretical Background

Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is an advanced reinforcement learning algorithm designed to:

- **Balance Exploration and Exploitation**: Carefully adjusts policy updates to avoid excessively large changes, enhancing stability.
- **Optimize via Actor-Critic Framework**: Combines an actor (decision-making policy) and a critic (value estimation) in a single neural network.

### PPO Key Concepts:

- **Policy Gradient**: Optimizes the policy by estimating gradients directly from environment interactions.
- **Clipped Objective**: Limits policy updates to prevent instability.
- **Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)**: Provides stable advantage estimates, critical for effective learning.

---

## üìÅ Detailed Workflow

### Step 1: Actor-Critic Network Initialization

- Utilizes a shared neural network structure (`ActorCriticNet`) with two heads:
  - **Actor head**: Outputs probabilities for actions (policy).
  - **Critic head**: Estimates state values, guiding policy updates.

### Step 2: Trajectory Collection

- Policy interacts with the trading environment to collect trajectories:
  - Observations, actions, rewards, and corresponding probabilities are recorded.
  - Actions are selected probabilistically, balancing exploration and exploitation.

### Step 3: Computing Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)

GAE computes advantages by combining immediate and discounted future rewards, improving gradient stability:

\[ A_t = \delta_t + (\gamma \lambda)A_{t+1} \]

where:

- \( \delta_t \) is the temporal difference error.
- \( \gamma \) is the discount factor.
- \( \lambda \) is the smoothing factor.

Advantages are normalized to enhance training stability.

### Step 4: PPO Policy Update

The PPO algorithm updates the policy by:

- Calculating the ratio of new and old probabilities of actions.
- Clipping these ratios to limit overly large updates:

\[ L^{CLIP}(\theta) = \hat{\mathbb{E}}[ \min(r_t(\theta) A_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1 - \epsilon, 1 + \epsilon) A_t] \]

- Optimizing a combined loss:

\[ Loss = L^{CLIP}(\theta) + c_1 \cdot L^{VALUE}(\theta) - c_2 \cdot H(\pi) \]

where:
- \(L^{VALUE}\) minimizes the difference between predicted and actual returns.
- \(H(\pi)\) encourages exploration by maximizing entropy (policy uncertainty).

---

## üìä Computational Efficiency and Stability

- PPO is designed specifically to avoid catastrophic policy updates, providing stable convergence:
  - Gradient clipping prevents numerical instability.
  - Mini-batch updates further stabilize learning and leverage GPU parallelism.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Distributed Training

- PPO training is designed to work effectively with distributed systems:
  - Rank 0 handles saving and critical updates.
  - Other ranks contribute to gradient computation and parallel data collection.

---

## üö© Mathematical Details

### PPO Loss Function

**Clipped Surrogate Objective:**
$$
L^{CLIP}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}\left[ \min\left( r(\theta) A, \text{clip}\left(r(\theta),\, 1 - \epsilon,\, 1 + \epsilon\right) A \\right]
$$

**Where:**  
- \( r(\theta) = \frac{\pi_{\theta}(a|s)}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(a|s)} \): Probability ratio of the new and old policies.  
- \( A \): Advantage estimate (from GAE).

**Value Loss:**
$$
L^{\text{VALUE}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}\left[ (V_{\theta}(s) - R)^2 \right]
$$

**Entropy Bonus (Encouraging Exploration):**
$$
H(\pi) = -\mathbb{E}[\pi(a|s)\log\pi(a|s)]
$$

### Final PPO Loss:
The combined loss function used in PPO training is given by:
$$
L(\theta) = L^{CLIP}(\theta) + c_1 \cdot L^{VALUE}(\theta) - c_2 \cdot H(\pi)
$$

**Where:**  
- \( c_1, c_2 \): Coefficients balancing value loss and entropy regularization, respectively.

This combination of losses stabilizes policy updates while promoting sufficient exploration during training.
